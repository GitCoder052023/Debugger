# Deep Dive in Dev:

## Debugger
Debugger provides a powerful tool for developers to streamline their debugging process. It is designed to automate the process of debugging code, making it more efficient and less time-consuming.

**Key Features:**

- Leverages Google's Gemini Pro language model for intelligent code analysis.
- Automatically retrieves code from the clipboard for seamless debugging.
- Generates potential fixes based on AI-powered insights.
- Automatically apply fixes within the code editor.


**Key Components:**

- **Debugger Class:** Encapsulates the debugging functionality.
- **debugger() Method:**
  - Retrieves code from the clipboard.
  - Utilizes GoogleGenerativeAI to generate potential fixes.
  - Applies fixes using PyAutoGUI.
- **remove_first_and_last_lines() Function:** Cleans up AI-generated code formatting.

## Usage

1. **Import the Debugger Class:**
  ```python
  from Dev.Developer import Dev
  ```

2. **Create a Debugger Instance with Your API Key:**
  ```python
  debugger = Dev.Dev(your-key)
  ```

3. **Initiate Debugging:**
  - **When an error occurs:**
   ```python
   debugger.Debugger(error) # Pass the error message as an argument
   ```
  - **To provide a specific prompt for guidance:**
   ```python
   debugger.Debugger(error, prompt="Add a comment explaining this line of code")
   ```

## Sample code
```python
from Dev.Developer import Dev
from key import key # please create a new python file "key" then paste your key inside their 

debugger = Dev.Dev(key) # you can directly paste your api key

try:
  def greet_user(name):
    print("Hello, " + uname + "!") # Typo: uname instead of name

  greet_user("Alice")

except Exception as e:
  debugger.Debugger(e)
```

## README Generator
